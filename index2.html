  <h1>Lukas Finch</h1>
  <p> I am Lukas Finch, a transfer Sophmore at <a href="Huntington.edu">Huntington University</a> this year. I am majoring in <strong>Computer Science!</strong>
  My biggest goals here are to learn and grow in my faith and education while creating new relationships and connecting with more christians. In my free time I like: playing games, hanging out with my friends and doing digital art. I also really like physical activity like longboarding and swimming. <br> I have lived in a lot of different places in my life. I grew up in California, moved to Illonois in 2017, then New Mexico in 2020, Rhode Island in 2023, now Indiana. So far my time here has been pretty sweet and I am enjoying the area quite a lot.</p>
  <p><h3>My top 3 favorite foods are</h3></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Sushi</li>
    <li>Steak</li>
    <li>Pulled Pork</li>
  </ul>
